OPAL-CI
-------

Magic scripts for doing CI regression testing.

Currently the makefile targets building op-build firmware (targeted at Mambo
simulator) for all current op-build releases.

Since skiboot maintains compatibility, these binaries should *ALWAYS* boot
and work.

The provided makefile to recreate the various zImage.epapr images should be
a good starting point.

I run it like this:
cd opal-ci
export BUILDROOT_GIT=~/op-build/.git/modules/buildroot/
export OP_BUILD_GIT=~/op-build/
export DL_CACHE=~/op-build/dl
export SCRATCH=/scratch/stewart/op-build/
make -j2 images

DL_CACHE points to an existing op-build tree, so we don't have to download
all the source tarballs again

SCRATCH is where all compilation will happen, must have >20GB free space

BUILDROOT_GIT and OP_BUILD_GIT exist to prevent you having to clone from
github.
