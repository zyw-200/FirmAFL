 * Sapphire device-tree requirements
 *

 *
 * This documents the generated device-tree requirements, this is based on
 * a commented device-tree dump obtained from a DT generated by Sapphire
 * itself from an HDAT.
 */

/*
 * General comments:
 *
 *  - skiboot does not require nodes to have phandle properties, but
 *    if you have them then *all* nodes must have them including the
 *    root of the device-tree (currently a HB bug !). It is recommended
 *    to have them since they are needed to represent the cache levels.
 *
 *    NOTE: The example tree below only has phandle properties for
 *    nodes that are referenced by other nodes. This is *not* correct
 *    and is purely done for keeping this document smaller, make sure
 *    to follow the rule above.
 *
 *  - Only the "phandle" property is required. Sapphire also generates
 *    a "linux,phandle" for backward compatibility but doesn't require
 *    it as an input
 *
 *  - Any property not specifically documented must be put in "as is"
 *
 *  - All ibm,chip-id properties contain a HW chip ID which correspond
 *    on P8 to the PIR value shifted right by 7 bits, ie. it's a 6-bit
 *    value made of a 3-bit node number and a 3-bit chip number.
 *
 *  - Unit addresses (@xxxx part of node names) should if possible use
 *    lower case hexadecimal to be consistent with what skiboot does
 *    and to help some stupid parsers out there...
