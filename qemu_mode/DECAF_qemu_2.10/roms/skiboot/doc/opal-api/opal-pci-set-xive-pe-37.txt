OPAL_PCI_SET_XIVE_PE
--------------------

static int64_t opal_pci_set_xive_pe(uint64_t phb_id, uint32_t pe_number,
				    uint32_t xive_num)

WARNING: following documentation is from old sources, and is possibly
not representative of OPALv3 as implemented by skiboot. This should be
used as a starting point for full documentation.

The host calls this function to bind a PE to an XIVE. Only that PE may then
signal an MSI that selects this XIVE.

    The phb_id parameter is the value from the PHB node ibm,opal-phbid
    property.

    the pe_number is the index of a PE, from 0 to ibm,opal-num-pes minus 1.

    The xive_number is the index, from 0 to ibm,opal,ibm-num-msis minus
    (num_lsis+1)

    This call maps the XIVR indexed by xive_num to the PE specified by
    pe_number. For ibm,opal-ioda HW, the pe_number must match the pe_number
    set in the MVE.

Return value:
	if (!phb)
		return OPAL_PARAMETER;
	if (!phb->ops->set_xive_pe)
		return OPAL_UNSUPPORTED;
