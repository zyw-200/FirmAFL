OPAL_HANDLE_INTERRUPT
---------------------

The host OS must pass all interrupts in "ibm,opal/opal-interrupts" in the
device tree to OPAL.

An example dt snippet is:

  ibm,opal {
            ...
            opal-interrupts = <0x10 0x11 0x12 0x13 0x14 0x20010 0x20011 0x20012 0x20013 0x20014 0xffe 0xfff 0x17fe 0x17ff 0x2ffe 0x2fff 0x37fe 0x37ff 0x20ffe 0x20fff 0x217fe 0x217ff 0x22ffe 0x22fff 0x237fe 0x237ff>;
  }

When the host OS gets any of these interrupts, it must call
OPAL_HANDLE_INTERRUPT.

The OPAL_HANDLE_INTERRUPT call takes two parameters, one input and one output.

uint32_t isn - the interrupt

uint64_t *outstanding_event_mask - returns outstanding events for host
	 			   OS to handle

The host OS should then handle any outstanding events.

See opal-poll-events.txt for documentation on events.
