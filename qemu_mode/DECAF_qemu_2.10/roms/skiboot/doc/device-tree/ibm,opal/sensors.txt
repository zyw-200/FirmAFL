ibm,opal/sensors/ device tree nodes
--------------------------------------

All sensors of a POWER8 system are made available to the OS in the
ibm,opal/sensors/ directory. Each sensor is identified with a node
which name follows this pattern :

	<resource class name>@<resource identifier>/

For example :

	core-temp@20/

Each node has a minimum set of properties describing the sensor :

  - a "compatible" property which should be "ibm,opal-sensor"

  - a "sensor-type" property, which can be "temp", "fan", "power".
    More will be added when new resources are supported. This type
    is used "as is" by the Linux driver to map sensors in the sysfs
    interface of the hwmon framework of Linux.

  - a "sensor-data" property giving a unique handler for the
    OPAL_SENSOR_READ call to be used by Linux to get the value of
    a sensor attribute. A sensor handler has the following encoding :

		|  Attr. |  Res.  |   Resource     |
		| Number | Class  |      Id        |
		|--------|--------|----------------|

  - a "sensor-status" property giving the state of the sensor. The
    status bits have the slightly meanings depending on the resource
    type but testing against 0x6 should raise an alarm.

  - an optional "label" property


Each node can have some extra properties depending on the resource
they represent. See the tree below for more information.
