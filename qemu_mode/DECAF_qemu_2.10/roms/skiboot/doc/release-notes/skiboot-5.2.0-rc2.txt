skiboot-5.2.0-rc2
-----------------

skiboot-5.2.0-rc2 was released on Wednesday March 9th, 2016.

skiboot-5.2.0-rc2 is the second release candidate of skiboot 5.2, which will
become the new stable release of skiboot following the 5.1 release, first
released August 17th, 2015.

skiboot-5.2.0-rc2 contains all bug fixes as of skiboot-5.1.14.

This is the second release that will follow the (now documented) Skiboot
stable rules - see doc/stable-skiboot-rules.txt.

The current plan is to release skiboot-5.2.0 mid-March 2016, with a focus on
bug fixing for future 5.2.0-rc releases (if any - I hope this will be the last)

Over skiboot-5.2.0-rc1, we have the following changes:

New platform!
- Add Barreleye platform

Generic:
- hw/p8-i2c: Speed up SMBUS_WRITE
