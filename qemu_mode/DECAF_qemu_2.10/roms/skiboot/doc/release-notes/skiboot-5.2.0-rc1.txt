skiboot-5.2.0-rc1
-----------------

skiboot-5.2.0-rc1 was released on Friday Feb 26th, 2016.

skiboot-5.2.0-rc1 is the first release candidate of skiboot 5.2, which will
become the new stable release of skiboot following the 5.1 release, first
released August 17th, 2015.

skiboot-5.2.0-rc1 contains all bug fixes as of skiboot-5.1.13.

This is the second release that will follow the (now documented) Skiboot
stable rules - see doc/stable-skiboot-rules.txt.

The current plan is to release skiboot-5.2.0 mid-March 2016, with a focus on
bug fixing for future 5.2.0-rc releases.

Over skiboot-5.1, the following features have been added:
- Naples (P8', i.e. P8 with NVLINK) processor support, including NVLINK.
- Improvements in gard, libflash/pflash and opal-prd utilities
  - increased testing
  - increased usability
  - systemd scripts for opal-prd
  - pflash can now use the /dev/mtd device to access BMC flash rather than
    accessing it directly. It is *important* that you use --mtd if your
    BMC may otherwise know how to interact with its own flash.
- support for Micron N25Q256Ax and N25Qx256Ax NOR flash.
- support for Winbond W25Q256BV NOR flash
- support for an emulated ("fake") RTC clock, useful in simulators
  and during bringup
- Explicit 1:1 mapping in ranges properties have been added to PCI
  bridges. This allows a neat trick with offb and VGA ports that should
  probably not be told to young children.
- Added support to read the V2 format of the OCC-OPAL memory region,
  which supports Workload Optimized Frequency (WOF)

Changes in behavior:
- Assigning OPAL IDs to PHBs is now fixed and based on the chip id and PHB
  index on that chip. On POWER7, we continue to use allocated numbers.
- We now query the BMC for BT capabilities rather than making assumptions

Removed support:
- p5ioc2 is no longer supported.
  This affects a grand total of two POWER7 systems in the world.
NOTE: It is planned that skiboot-5.2 will be the last release supporting
POWER7 machines.

Bugs fixed:
- PHB3: Fix unexpected ER (all) on errinjct by PCI config
- hw/bt: timeout messages when BT interface isn't functional
- On Habanero, Slot3 should have been "Slot 3".
- We now completely flush the console buffer before power down and reboot
- For chips with ibm,occ-functional-state set to false, we don't wait
  for the OCC to start. This caused needless delay in booting on simulators
  which did not simulate OCCs.
- Change OCC reset order to always reset slave OCCs first.
- slw: Remove overwrites for EX_PM_CORE_ECO_VRET and EX_PM_CORE_PFET_VRET
  (these were already initialized in hostboot)
- p8-i2c: send stop bit on timeouts.
  Some devices can otherwise leave the bus in a held state.

Other improvements include:
- many fixes of compiler and static analysis warnings
- increased unit test coverage
- Unit test of "boot debian jessie installer"
- ability to plug in other simulators to run existing tests (e.g. simulator for
  non pegasus p8)
- Support using (patched) Qemu with PowerNV platform support for running
  unit tests.
- increased support for running with sparse
- We now build with -fstack-protector-strong if supported by the compiler
- We now build with -Werror for -Wformat
- pflash is now built as part of travis-ci and for Coverity Scan.
- There is now a RPM SPEC file that can be used as the basis for packaging
  skiboot and associated utilities.

------------

We have had a number of improvements in workflow over skiboot-5.1.0. Looking
back, we have roughly the same number of changesets (372 for 5.1.0, 334 for
5.2.0-rc1 - even closer for 5.1.0-beta1) which indicates a relatively stable
rate of development.

Complete statistics are included below (generated by gitdm), but I'd like to
draw attention to a couple of stats:

Release	 csets	Ack	Reviews	Tested	Reported
5.0	 329	 15	     20	     1	       0
5.1	 372	 13	     38	     1	       4
5.2-rc1	 334	 20	     34	     6	      11

Overall, it looks like we're on the right trajectory for increasing the number
of eyeballs looking at code before it heads in tree, especially around testing.
Largely, this increase in Tested-by can be attributed to encouraging the
existing test teams to start commenting on the patches themselves.

Anyway, here's the full stats from skiboot 5.1.0 to 5.2.0-rc1:
