# FIRM-AFL

FIRM-AFL is the first high-throughput greybox fuzzer for IoT firmware. FIRM-AFL addresses two fundamental problems in IoT fuzzing. First, it addresses compatibility issues by enabling fuzzing for POSIX-compatible firmware that can be emulated in a system emulator. Second, it addresses the performance bottleneck caused by system-mode emulation with a novel technique called "augmented process emulation". By combining system-mode emulation and user-mode emulation in a novel way, augmented process emulation provides high compatibility as system-mode emulation and high throughput as user-mode emulation.

## Introduction

FIRM-AFL is the first high-throughput greybox fuzzer for IoT firmware. FIRM-AFL addresses two fundamental problems in IoT fuzzing. First, it addresses compatibility issues by enabling fuzzing for POSIX-compatible firmware that can be emulated in a system emulator. Second, it addresses the performance bottleneck caused by system-mode emulation with a novel technique called "augmented process emulation". By combining system-mode emulation and user-mode emulation in a novel way, augmented process emulation provides high compatibility as system-mode emulation and high throughput as user-mode emulation. The overview is show in Figure 1.

&nbsp;

We design and implement FIRM-AFL, an enhancement of AFL for fuzzing IoT firmware. We keep the workflow of AFL intact and replace the user-mode QEMU with augmented process emulation, and the rest of the components remain unchanged. The new workflow is illustrated in Figure 2.

## Dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install -y libsdl1.2-dev zlib1g-dev libglib2.0-dev binutils-dev build-essential binutils qemu libboost-dev git lib tool autoconf xorg-dev
```


## Setup

Our system has two parts: system mode and user mode. We compile them separately for now.

### User mode 
	cd user_mode/
	./configure --target-list=mipsel-linux-user,mips-linux-user,arm-linux-user --static --disable-werror
	make

### System mode
	cd qemu_mode/DECAF_qemu_2.10/
	./configure --target-list=mipsel-softmmu,mips-softmmu,arm-softmmu --disable-werror
	make

## Usage

1.  Download the Firmdyne repo to the root directory of FirmAFL, then setup the firmadyne according to its instructions including importing its datasheet https://cmu.app.boxcn.net/s/hnpvf1n72uccnhyfe307rc2nb9rfxmjp into database.

2.  Replace the scripts/makeImage.sh with modified one in firmadyne_modify directory.

3.  follow the guidance from firmadyne to generate the system running scripts. 
>Take DIR-815 router firmware as a example,
	
	cd firmadyne
	python3 ./sources/extractor/extractor.py -b dlink -sql 127.0.0.1 -np -nk "../firmware/DIR-815_FIRMWARE_1.01.ZIP" images
	./scripts/getArch.sh ./images/9050.tar.gz
	python3 ./scripts/tar2db.py -i 9050 -f ./images/9050.tar.gz
	./scripts/makeImage.sh 9050
	./scripts/inferNetwork.sh 9050
	cd ..
	python3 FirmAFL_setup.py 9050 mipsel

4. modify the run.sh in image_9050 directory as following,  in order to emulate firmware with our modified QEMU and kernel, and running on the RAM file.
>For mipsel,

	ARCHEND=mipsel
	[...]
	
>For mipseb,

	ARCHEND=mipseb
	[...]

5. run the fuzzing process
>after running the start.py script, FirmAFL will start the firmware emulation, and after the system initialization(120s), the fuzzing process will start. (Maybe you should use root privilege to run it.)

	cd image_9050
	python3 start.py 9050

## Troubleshooting

(1) error: static declaration of ‘memfd_create’ follows non-static declaration

Please see https://blog.csdn.net/newnewman80/article/details/90175033.

(2) failed to find romfile "efi-e1000.rom"  when run the "run.sh"

Use the run.sh in FirmAFL_config/9050/ instead.

(3) Fork server crashed with signal 11

Run scripts in start.py sequentially. First run "run.sh", when the testing program starts, run "python test.py", and "user.sh".

(4) For the id "12978", "16116" firmware, since these firmware have more than 1 test case, so we use different image directory name to distinguish them.
	
	Before FirmAFL_setup, 
	first, change image directory name image_12978 to image_129780, 
	then modify the firmadyne/scratch/12978 to firmadyne/scratch/129780
	After that, run python FirmAFL_setup.py 129780 mips
	(If you want to test another case for image_12978, you can use image_129781 instead image_129780)
