skiboot-5.1.11
--------------

skiboot-5.1.11 was released on Friday November 13th, 2015.

Since it was Friday 13th, we had to find a bug right after we tagged
and released skiboot-5.1.10.

skiboot-5.1.11 is the 12th stable release of 5.1, it follows skiboot-5.1.10
(which was released November 13th, 2015).

Skiboot 5.1.11 contains one additional bug fix over skiboot-5.1.10.

It is:
- On IBM FSP machines, if IPMI/Serial console is not connected during shutdown
  or reboot, machine would enter termination state rather than shut down.
